## Trace Blocking

The objective of this step is to inspect how Lodash implements their behavior.  You will expand your function into a trace-block illustrating where each variable derives it's value, and how those variables are used step-by-step detail.

_Implementation_ is the exact steps used to implement a behavior.

___

1. Trace-block your function in ./1-___-trace-blocked.js
    * Indicate where each variable derives it's value
    * Include the specs for each dependency
    * Expand any expression taking 3 or more values into it's own trace-block
2. Fill out the Part-Task section of the README.  Put any part-task exercises you made in the ./exercises folder, they can be designed for the browser or Node
