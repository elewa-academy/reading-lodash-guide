# Reading Lodash Guide

Here are instructions for the Reading Lodash exercise. The main objectives are:
* Interacting with programs exclusively via source code & terminal
* Understanding code at a behavioral level
* Test cases and testing
* Profiling variables based on how they are used
* Chunking code by behavior
* Deciphering strategy from source code
* Refactoring & non-breaking changes

To complete this exercise: clone the [reading-lodash-template](https://github.com/elewa-academy/reading-lodash-template), select a function from /node_modules/lodash, and complete the steps in this repo one at a time.

It's important that you understand each step before moving on to the next.  If you are struggling to complete a step, don't force yourself forward.  Instead, select a new function and complete as many steps as you comfortably can. When you have reached the next level of comfort, you can return to your incomplete exercises and move them forward.
