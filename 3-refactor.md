## Refactor

De-trace-block your step 2, turn your chunk-block into a working JS file.  You will know you have successfully completed this step when ./3-___-refactor.js passes all of your original test cases.

_Refactoring_ is modifying your source code without changing it's behavior. 

___


* Replace your "dep" object with require statements
* Remove your chunk functions from their "closure" object and place them at the bottom of your file.
* Write test cases for you chunk functions and put them along-side
* De-trace-block the main function & export it (above the chunk functions)
* Copy paste the docs from the original file
* Test it using your original test cases.  If everything is green, win.  Else, go back and fix.
