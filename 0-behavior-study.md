## Behavior Study

The objective of this step is to thoroughly understand the behavior of your Lodash function.

_Behavior_ is defined by inputs/output pairs.  

___

0. Make a new repo, name it after your chosen function. Re-title the README.md in your template.
1. Copy the docs for your function from Lodash into your readme. You'll find this either in source comments, or in their online docs.
2. Complete the Input Analysis section of the README, tables work well for this.
3. Create a whole lot of test cases in ./test/test-cases.js.
    * Be sure to test your test cases using the Repl.it in the Lodash docs.
    * The template indicates how you should structure your test cases.   
4. Copy paste the source for your function into ./0-___.js.  Be sure to line up the require statements.  
5. Run your test cases on the original Lodash function.  If any fail you are wrong, not Lodash.  Fix your test cases.  
6. Done!  You have now 100% understood the behavior of your function.  Time to move on and study the implementation.
